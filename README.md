# ESCAPE

The NIST TN2262, ESCAPE has received national attention and has been amplified by the US Fire Administrator and USFA. ESCAPE is serving to demonstrate the need for a paradigm shift in Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) fire evacuations and save thousands of lives. The concepts presented in TN2262 are complex and national feedback had been used to revise the TN and re-release it in February 2025. While TN2262 is extremely well received, feedback has identified the need for an online educational tool to help practitioners understand and use the fundamental paradigm shifts presented in ESCAPE. This NIST product is designed for a non-technical audience. The NIST online ESCAPE Educational Tool is designed to address the needs of community leaders, fire marshals, fire chiefs, sheriffs and other first responders involved in designing and executing WUI community notification and evacuation plans.
